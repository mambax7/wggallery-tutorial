On the right side you will see the area for sorting albums/collections.

## 2. Differences between albums and collections

### Album

An album contains one or more images. You can set the permissions for each album in a different way.

### Collections

Collections are like a container or folder for one or more albums. Permissions set for a collection are not valid for the contained albums.  
A collection should not have images, as they will be nowhere displayed.  
you can recognize a collection on the displayed number of albums in it:

You can easily sort them by drag&drop.   
With a click on "+" you can expand a collection, with "-" reduce it.  
You can create a nested tree up to as many levels you want.
